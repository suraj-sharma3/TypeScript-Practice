1. We can also create a typescript project with vite which is a frontend build tool with the below given command. The command will create a normal or vanilla typescript project. TypeScript is used with several frameworks like React, Angular, etc and commands to create typescript projects with these frameworks are different. The below given command will just create a simple typescript project.

    npm create vite@latest my-vite-ts-project --template vanilla-ts
    Here my-vite-ts-project is the project name

After executing the command, answer the prompts in the terminal and create the project accordingly.

2. Below given commands can be executed to run the created project : 
    1. cd first-vite-ts-project : move into the project folder
    2. npm install : install the dependencies
    3. npm run dev : run the project

3. We can run the "npm run build" command to build the project. This command creates a dist (distribution) folder in the project folder which contains the js file containing all the ts code of the project. This command basically bundles the entire project's ts code into a single js file which is present in the assets folder within the dist folder.

4. We can also run the command "npm run preview" command to preview or run the project

# 📌 Recommended `.gitignore` for a TypeScript Project  

## 🚀 Why Use a `.gitignore` File?  
A `.gitignore` file prevents unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked by Git, ensuring a clean and efficient repository. Below is a recommended `.gitignore` file for a **TypeScript project**.  

## 📂 **.gitignore Content**  
```gitignore  
# Node.js dependencies  
node_modules/  

# TypeScript compiled files  
dist/  
out/  
build/  

# TypeScript cache and logs  
*.tsbuildinfo  
*.log  

# Environment variables and secrets  
.env  
.env.local  
.env.*.local  

# Editor & OS-specific files  
.vscode/  
.idea/  
.DS_Store  
Thumbs.db  

# Package manager lock files (optional)  
pnpm-lock.yaml  
yarn.lock  
```  

## 🔹 Explanation of Each Entry  
### **1️⃣ Node.js Dependencies**  
- **`node_modules/`** → Prevents tracking dependencies installed via `npm` or `yarn`.
  - These are downloaded via `npm install` or `yarn install`, so there's no need to commit them.

### **2️⃣ TypeScript Build Output**  
- **`dist/`, `out/`, `build/`** → These are compiled output directories and should not be committed.  
  - These files are generated by TypeScript when you run `tsc` or `npm run build`.
  
### **3️⃣ TypeScript Cache and Logs**  
- **`*.tsbuildinfo`** → Caches for TypeScript incremental builds (used with `--incremental`).  
- **`*.log`** → Log files generated by package managers or debugging tools (e.g., `npm-debug.log`, `yarn-error.log`).  

### **4️⃣ Environment Variables and Secrets**  
- **`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`** → Environment variable files to protect sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials).  
  - Never commit `.env` files to Git; use `.env.example` instead.  

### **5️⃣ Editor & OS-Specific Files**  
- **`.vscode/`, `.idea/`** → IDE/editor-specific configurations that should not be shared.  
- **`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`** → OS-specific system files that are unnecessary.  

### **6️⃣ Package Manager Lock Files (Optional)**  
- **`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`** → Some teams prefer to exclude lock files if using multiple package managers.  
  - However, keeping `package-lock.json` (for npm) ensures reproducible builds.

## ✅ Best Practices for `.gitignore`  
1. **Use a Global `.gitignore`**: Prevent unnecessary files from being committed across all projects by setting up a global `.gitignore`.  
   ```sh  
   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global  
   ```  
2. **Keep `.gitignore` Updated**: If your project changes (e.g., new build folders), update the `.gitignore` accordingly.  
3. **Use `git rm --cached <file>`**: If you accidentally committed a file that should be ignored, remove it from Git's tracking:  
   ```sh  
   git rm --cached <file>  
   ```  
4. **Check `.gitignore` Before Committing**: Ensure you’re not missing any files that should be ignored.  

A Git repository typically has only one .gitignore file at the root level. However, you can have multiple .gitignore files within different subdirectories to apply ignore rules specifically to those directories.

🔹 How Multiple .gitignore Files Work
Global .gitignore: Applies to all repositories on your system (~/.gitignore_global).
Project-level .gitignore: Placed in the root of the repo, affecting all tracked files.
Subdirectory .gitignore: Placed inside specific folders to ignore files only in that directory
